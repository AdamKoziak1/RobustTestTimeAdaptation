TODO:

resnet18 first, then resnet50. insufficient VRAM for VIT (at default batch size at least)
  models other than resnet18 will need change in layer selection for cr_loss

maybe log per step
  figure out seed issue here

LoRA model updates
  https://github.com/huggingface/peft

low rank augmentation of image (throw away high rank values - noise)
  maybe just lower layers
  SVD, remove lowest values (below threshold) and reconstruct feature maps 

EMV update

class prototypes
  cosine similarity to classify each feature based on mean features 

To run:
  style transfer (TENT method for params)
    just MI loss, then sweep lambda3 and stuff
  maybe just featurizer?
