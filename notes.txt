TODO:
  resnet18 first, then resnet50
    models other than resnet18 will need change in layer selection for cr_loss

  EMV update

  class prototypes
    cosine similarity to classify each feature based on mean features 

  LORA:
    update requirements for peft

  use PL loss combined with MI - check SHOT


svd variations:
/erm     185
/tent    160 185
/PL      130 185
/SHOT-IM 145 185
/T3A     150 185
/TSD     125 190
TTA3-MI 150 185
TTA3-CR 160 185

ideas:
lp-bounded attacks could operate in low singular value space
  what if attacker knows this?
    consider stronger attacks
      (AutoAttack‑TTA and DIA; RTTDP, integrate ImageNet‑C subset)
theory note on spectral filtering + BN; derive error bound
profile runtime more precisely


learnable svd threshold?
